						<!-- IT Interest -->
							<article id="interestIt">
								<h1 style="text-align:center;">IT Interest</h1>
								<br>
								<p>  I personally like IT very much as it fascinates me everytime I come across it in every aspect be it productivity, application and its wide range of usage all over the world. </p>
								<p>  Things that really interests me in the field of IT will be mobile phones, automation, AI, holograms and so on and I really get fascinated by their evolution over time and for the future and I find them really interesting on how they can be so cool and help us so much in our lives. </p>
                <p>  I did a diploma in Electronic and Computer engineering  previously in Singapore where I learnt some basic programming on C, C+,C++ and C# using the Visual studio Software and also to program Arduino boards and do linking of databases in the process. </p>
								<p>  I personally chose this IT course from RMIT online firstly because RMIT being   well-recognised in the area of IT study and I believe it can help me strengthen and provide me a good foundation to help me continue my studies in the area of IT while studying this course online too can make it flexible in the midst of the busy schedule </p>
								<p>  Through this course, I hope to get good knowledge and understanding on the IT sector and the applications so that it can help me in pursuing a job in IT sector in the future. Also, I hope to gain more knowledge and experience from fellow classmates and the professors in the course and network and make friends as we share common interests in IT in this course. </p>

								<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51147814?type=standout#searchRequestToken=3abcd32b-a56e-4e8e-b4aa-61d8c6436b29">Click here for Job Link</a></p>
								<p>   I feel firstly this job is in line with my interest in AI and automation development and thus, at first look appealed to me given the role in development of automation tasks. Next, the fact that it is in a reputable company IBM which is an established and expert AI and automation appeals to me as it is a well reputable company and will be a good working job in that sense. The position allows me to travel interstate and other places that appeals to me as I don’t have to stay at the same location for work and I can travel around and explore and experience more places and possibly learn from the automation and AI in those places. The benefits and perks section appeals further as they have stated there will flexible working options and caters to our style and needs.</p>
								<p>   The requirements for this job will be to have hands on experience in process analysis and design using UI path, a strong analytical background, proven problem solver, excellent documentation and communication skills, proven ability to run workshops and meetings with different stakeholder groups, client mindset and to demonstrate consulting and delivery excellence.</p>
								<p>  The skills, qualifications and experience I have as of now will be more on basic programming on C, C+ and C++, basic java coding, html and css and a diploma in electronics and computer engineering and basic analytics, presentation and problem solving abilities. </p>
								<p>   To fulfil the requirements for the job position, I have to build on my knowledge on automation especially in the area of AI which I plan to it through this course in RMIT I am studying to acquire knowledge on it especially UI path. I also have to build on my analytics and design knowledge to meet stakeholder groups and clients and on communication and presenting to them which I feel I can build and practice on it through this course in RMIT along the way and also exposing myself to this situations and information online and real life.</p>

								<h3> •	Myers-Briggs test </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="16 personalities test.JPG" alt="" /></span>
                <p> I feel that as this result points out, I am a ESFJ-A consul assertive type. This means that I am people oriented and tend to be up to date with social relationships. Also means that I am the person who likes to keep the energy going among a group and motivate and support people. This also points out the part where I am a person who prefers things in a organised and clean way and give importance to values and morals. I am also the type who regrets outcomes more than my actions. </p>
								<p> Given this meaning, I feel that my behaviour in the team will be to drive and support people emotions and ideas and organise them accordingly. I feel this will help the team to achieve stability and momentum in the way of coming to do tasks and moving on further from it. </p>
								<p> I feel that given this results, I will feel I will form a team with people who respects each other and open to ideas and get a few members who can innovate ideas and I am more of the person who might lack this innovation needed as inferred by my personality weakness results </p>
								<br>
								<h3> •	Learning styles </h3>
							  <span class="image main"><img src="Learning Styles.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p> I feel that as the results shows I am more of a pragmatist type learner where I learn better when things are done practically or through discussions. This is followed closely by activist where I learn through brainstorming and roleplaying in group discussions and theorist which means learning through models and tutorials. Lowest type will be the reflector style which means I learn lesser from careful and analytical learning through self analysis questionnaires and time out discussions.</p>
								<p> This results from online test might mean the behaviour in my team will be more on hands on and practical based and I will be nvolved more in discussions and brainstorming ideas actively. </p>
								<p> So when forming group, I will consider  team members  who can be active and be practical and hands on when trying out ideas and actively discussing ideas. Also, I will look for some one in the team who can be observant  and carefullu analyse our ideas and help us in reflections and checking on our ideas.</p>
								<br>
								<h3> •	Leadership Style </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="Leadership Styles.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p> From the results, this means that I care for others and enjoying looking out and seeing us grow together. I am also the person who bind people together and communities while having ethical priorities and humility for interactions.</p>
								<p> This result shows that my behaviour in group will be more on supporting and helping out each other in difficulties and help the team grow and enjoy together as a whole.</p>
								<p> So, when forming a group, I might look out for open minded, ethical and social and inclusive people who can connect with each other and allow the group to grow and learn together. </p>

								<article id="pIdea">
									<h1 style="text-align:center;">Project Idea</h1>
									<br>
									<p> As per my interest and my job scope in AI and automation, I would like to see an application of holograms to automate and initiate process to recover lost items in workplaces, house or in the public. So basically, this product helps user go about helping him find a lost product using its visual aspects and description along with the use of holographic analysis, automation, and AI algorithms through the analysis of environment.</p>
									<p> I feel that this is particularly useful in workplaces and houses where important documents or objects might get lost due to negligence or hectic and busy working and might overlook on them or misplace them.</p>
									<p> This can be supported by the following evidence. For example, according to a survey of 3,000 adults by a British insurance company found some interesting details.
										•	Four out of ten people admitted to arguing with their partners about lost items.
										•	The five most commonly lost items in the UK survey, in decreasing order: mobile / smartphone, house keys, car keys, paperwork, sunglasses/ glasses.
										•	Those surveyed spent an average of 10 minutes daily looking for such items.
										•	The average person surveyed lost nine items daily.
										•	That’s nearly 3,300 (3,285) items per year, and about 60 hours lost per year, or close to 2.5 days.
										•	Over an average of 60.5 years of adult life, that’s nearly 200K (198,742) items lost and 3,680 hours wasted, or over 150 days (153.3 days) in a lifetime.
										These figures vary from year to year, country to country, and of course some items are lost/misplaced over and over. Since 10 minutes was the average time in the British survey, some people are wasting more than 2.5 days per year looking for misplaced items. If you use the higher 55 minutes/day figure found by a Boston survey, that’s close to 2 weeks lost per year. That does not include time lost arguing with relationship partners, or in some cases, time lost having to return home/office to retrieve an item left behind. </p>
										<p> Mozy.com published an estimate, based on a survey of five countries, of about 1.24 items lost per person per year, and an average loss of nearly $100 ($95.78) per person per year – totalling billions of dollars per year collectively ($47B across all of five countries). That does not include the value of information on a phone, tablet, computer, or sentimental value of photos on a hard drive, nor the time it might take to have replacement items setup the same way — for example, a lost or stolen laptop, phone or tablet. If you lose something from work, that can also harm your career and have an impact far beyond the base cost of what was lost. </p>
										<p> This product can definitely help to save time, cost and effort in needing to go every place to find them or getting people or irritating them which can cause conflicts and mistrust. </p>
										<p> So basically this device I propose will have holographic, automation and AI capabilities to analyse the environment for the state the lost product and once it detects the object that matches the description, it points to the direction with a marker and a picture of the place and the surroundings it is in.</p>
										<p> Next, I will propose the functionality and features of this product. Firstly, the product will ask the user if he has any visual photo of the product or if not type the description using prompts from the device. Then, the device will then send out a hologram to cover the place that the user is in and start analysing the place with the help of AI and automation algorithms. When it detects the object that matches the description of the user, it takes and sends the picture of the object matched to the user and to confirm if it matches the object he is looking for. Once that is confirmed, the device then marks the place and guides the user to the place it is at using navigation tools and by showing the picture of the surroundings it is in. It also has analysis and storage of data lost by user previously and comes up with solutions to manage his items.</p>
										<p> The software tool needed might be s Natural Language Processing, AI-optimized storage systems and navigation software like GPS. Hardware tools that might be needed will be graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits or ASICs, and On-chip memory.</p>
										<p> Skills that might be needed are Complex Problem Solving as when problem solving needs to span multiple industries or when problems are not fully defined, humans can work backwards to figure out a solution,  Critical Thinking to connect, interpret and imagine concepts in a world full of ambiguity and nuance and power up the machines to solve them and creativity that  requires a degree of intuitive randomness that cannot yet be imitated by AI. Other skills that might be required include People management, coordinating with others, decision-making, negotiation, and serving others will all be important moving forward.</p>
										<p> If the project goes out well, the outcome will be a ease of mind when things get lost and lesser aggravation of emotions in the community. Also, lesser effort needed to find them and no need waste time lodging complaints on important lost stuff and saves time while this device can help going around looking for it. This development will have positive effects in a way things can be found easily and we can be more self-reliant given the technology is in our hands. This can help especially elderly whom might tend to be forgetful and can help them get to their objects easily. It also might reduce the reliant on police or even allow things to be found faster so that people wont misuse it before we find it. Negatives might be that given that this hologram will be sent out to the environment around, it can cause detection of other unwanted or unrelated objects that might resemble the description especially when near a lot of people and to solve this, a more accurate and complex algorithm might be needed to eliminate this ambiguity.</p>
